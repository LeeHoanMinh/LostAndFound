# LostAndFound

Introduction:
Lost & Found is a 2D indie game developed in 48 hours. This also gets the 1-st Runner Up Award in Gameloft GameJam 2020 competition.
And this is also my most favorite project, which is proof of my efforts through years.

Content:
To build up a family is not easy, and to maintain it is a tough job. This is the story about the hook-hook family, when there is a pandemic out here, so they have to be at home together. In home life, of course, there are some activities will increase your sanity, such as eating a humburger. And some, on the other hand, will decrease it, like your mom tell you to clean a room. The job of a player is to give activities for each person in a family so that no one reaches too low sanity. Because when someone in the family touches the limit, which means they feel too sad, they will abandon the family.

Gameplay: Card game
There are three cards represented for three activities. You can drag'em to family members for them to do that activity. Each interval of time, you can receive more energy. You can use that energy to change three cards into the new three ones. Life is not constant, sometimes there will be unexpected events, like a family member is sick. So if you do not prepare the appropriate card, maybe your member will be gone.
